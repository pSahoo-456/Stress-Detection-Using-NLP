# ðŸ§  Stress Detection using NLP & Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project aims to detect stress levels in text-based data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning models. The dataset undergoes text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification using an ensemble of machine learning classifiers.

## ðŸš€ Features

Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and cleaning.

Word Cloud Visualization: A graphical representation of the most common words.

TF-IDF Feature Extraction: Converts text into meaningful numerical representations.

Machine Learning Models: Uses NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM in an ensemble Voting Classifier.

Interactive Prediction: Users can input text to predict stress levels.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset (stress.csv) contains text samples labeled as Stress (1) or No Stress (0).
The model maps these labels to "Stress" and "No Stress" for better interpretability.
